# Future Timeline or event
Because Windows 10 2015 Long-Term Service Branch is supported until October 14th, 2025, this reposity must use .NET Framework 4.6.2 to support this operating system.

So after October 14th, 2025, which means Windows 10 2015 Long-Term Service Branch ended its lifecycle. This reposity will migrate to latest .NET Platform, which supported Windows 10 Build 14393(That means Windows 10 2016 Long-Term Service Branch, Windows Server 2016 or greater). 

After January 12th, 2027, which means Windows Server 2016 ended its lifecycle. There might have some supported OS changes. Before that day, we will show some changings. After that day, Our Program will migrate to Win UI 3

# About Linux supporting

Linux branch might be built after this reposity launched its first stable release.

And After October 14th, 2025, we might merge linux Branch and Windows Branch, which use C# and .NET Platform.
